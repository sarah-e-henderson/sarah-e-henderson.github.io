## Research Values & Approach

My work is grounded in the belief that language education should center student voices and encourage (linguistic) agency development. In my dissertation work, I draw on multiliteracies and critical language awareness frameworks to amplify students voices and challenge normative linguistic and literacy perspectives, advocating for expansive approaches to navigation of knowledge, expression and agency.

**Research-Informed Pedagogy**  
I believe in translating research directly into classroom practice. My dissertation findings on CLA and multiliteracies integration have shaped innovative pedagogical approaches, including podcast creation projects that allow students to explore personal interests while developing transferable skills. Students report learning to value their bilingualism in new ways and feeling empowered to direct their own learning paths.

**Commitment to Equity**  
My teaching approach and research addresses gaps in understanding how to create equitable multilingual learning environments. Through research-informed pedagogical approaches, I aim to best serve and support all students. I am particularly committed to supporting first-generation scholars and Latinx students, creating pathways for students to examine and value their ethnolinguistic backgrounds and those of their communities.

My research agenda and teaching philosophy reflects my broader commitment to social justice through language education, deeply valuing the importance of language use and its critical complexities, and bilingualism as a whole.
