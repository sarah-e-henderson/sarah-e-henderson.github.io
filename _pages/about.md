## Values & Approach
My work is grounded in the belief that education should center student voices and encourage agency development. Across language, linguistics, and humanities courses, I draw on multiliteracies and critical awareness frameworks to create equitable learning environments where students explore ideas through diverse modes of expression and knowledge-making.

**Research-Informed Pedagogy**  
I believe in translating research directly into classroom practice. My work on critical language awareness and multiliteracies integration has shaped innovative pedagogical approaches that transcend traditional language instruction. Whether teaching Spanish language courses, sociolinguistics seminars, language and society content, or interdisciplinary humanities courses, I design projects that foreground CLA and diverse literacies. These projects vary by course context but may include podcast creation, digital portfolios, multimodal research presentations, or other creative assignments that allow students to explore topics of personal and scholarly interest while developing transferable skills. In language courses, students report learning to value their bilingualism in new ways; in sociolinguistics and content courses, they discover how to analyze complex language phenomena and express critical perspectives through multiple literacies. Across contexts, students feel empowered to direct their own learning paths and make meaningful connections between course material and their lived experiences.

**Commitment to Equity**  
My teaching approach addresses gaps in understanding how to create equitable multilingual and multicultural learning environments across disciplinary contexts. Through research-informed pedagogical approaches, I aim to best serve and support all students, whether in language courses, content courses focused on culture and society, or interdisciplinary contexts. I am particularly committed to supporting first-generation scholars and Latinx students, creating pathways for students to examine and value their ethnolinguistic backgrounds, cultural knowledges, and community experiences within academic spaces.

My research agenda and teaching philosophy reflects my broader commitment to social justice through education, deeply valuing the critical complexities of language use, bilingualism, cultural production, and the multiple ways students navigate and express knowledge across academic spaces
